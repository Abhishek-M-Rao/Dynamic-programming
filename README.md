# Dynamic-programming
Using dynamic programming, I wrote functions to find the smallest element of a set, find the square root of a number,
 perform string comparisons which considers upper and lower case, and one that doesn't, recurisvely find the solution to a maze, 
 and finally return the least amount of coins needed for change for martian currency!
